# Resto - Multipurpose food and restaurant template

## Development server

Run `npm install` Open terminal navigated to root folder. This task will install all npm package dependencies.

Run `gulp` This will automatically start a server navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

Start editing scss/ js/ html/ filles from root folder - It will auto compile and reload the browser.

## Not familiar with modern tools? NO PROBLEM

Jump to public folder - you will find compiled css, js, html files and start editing them directly
